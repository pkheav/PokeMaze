// List of features/ideas that we may want to add to the maze puzzle.

===== Core Features =====
- Very basic maze GUI (i.e. one colour for walls and one colour for paths).
- Detection for when a maze is completed.
- Random maze generator (for various sizes/difficulties).
- Basic game menu with various options.
- Difficulty level selection (maze size etc).


===== Extra Features =====
- Tracking player scores/points earned.
- Item pickups that may be placed on mazeTiles (i.e. coins)
- Obstacles that must be navigated on mazeTiles.
- Collectables/achievements for achieving certain tasks (i.e. defeating a maze on the hardest difficulty etc).
- Multiplayer
- User created mazes
- Enemies (AI that travels through maze or in set paths).
- Basic collision-detection (maybe include weapons that can attack enemies that are on an adjacent tile).
> Limited visibility - can only see within a certain distance, eg. 5 squares and rest of the map is black


===== Art =====
- Work out a particular theme or themes for the game. (i.e. haunted/futuristic/underwater/etc)
- Menu GUI
- TileMap art for maze
- Opening/loading screen (don't think we will need a loading screen unless it actually takes a while for the game to be setup. ST)
